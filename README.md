Vision Assistant is an AI-powered accessibility platform designed to assist visually impaired and blind individuals. Upon launch, the system automatically activates the camera and begins real-time object detection.

The platform identifies objects in front of the user, determines their distance and direction, evaluates potential danger, and provides voice feedback instantly. Users can also upload images for object recognition.

The system supports three languages (English, Russian, Kazakh) and includes audio-based interaction, where buttons and interface elements are voiced during interaction to ensure full accessibility.

Vision Assistant eliminates the need for complex navigation or account registration, focusing instead on simplicity, safety, and real-time assistance to enhance independence and mobility.
